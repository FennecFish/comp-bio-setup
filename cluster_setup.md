# Cluster setup (specific to UNC)

Our lab primarily uses the killdevil cluster for computing. While you
may sometimes work locally on your laptop, you will eventually want to
also have the same code on the cluster, so you can run simulations for
example, without having to keep your laptop open and running. You may
also need to work on killdevil if you have data that cannot be
downloaded to a laptop.

The main pieces you need to work on killdevil are:

* X11 forwarding for when you SSH (so you can see plot windows)
* Some way of editing and running R code on the cluster,
  either [ESS](https://ess.r-project.org/)
  or [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) 
* Version control using [git](terminal_git_github.md).
